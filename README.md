# Go + Iris - Base API <a href="README_PTBR.md"><img width="20px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/800px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png?20220111182208" /></a>

This is an example API, built with [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Iris](https://www.iris-go.com/). The codebase was created to show a working backend application in Go, with different options of database clients.

## How it works

The repository is organized in 3 different branches: 

- master
- bun
- pgx
- sqlx

### master
The master branch contains only the file structres and example controllers. No DB, just the Iris framework.

#### [Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris)

> Iris is a fast, simple yet fully featured and very efficient web framework for Go.
> It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website or API.


### [bun](https://bun.uptrace.dev/)
> Simple and performant DB client for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

### [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)
> pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

### [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) 
> sqlx is a library which provides a set of extensions on go's standard database/sql library.

## Getting started

### Running for development

```sh
make run
```

### Building the app

Building just for current OS
```sh
make build
```

Buiding for multiple distributions
```sh
make build-all
```

### Testing the app

```sh
make test
```

## Additional

### Generating coverage in HTML
```sh
make cover-html
```

### Generating  badge
Everytime you call ```make test``` or ```make cover-html```, the badge in README.md gets updated, but you can do it manually:
```sh
make badge
```

### Cleaning the repo
